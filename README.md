# Alsoul

> **A companion with a world, not a chatbot with tools.**

Alsoul is a persistent personal companion architecture designed to remain one continuous person across model, process, thread, surface, channel, and provider changes.

The project is currently in **foundation convergence / pre-implementation**. The semantic backbone is converged through identity, history, memory, fresh world access, cognition/output, authority/effects, durable delegated work, and proactive initiation. The next architecture boundary is one Person across many surfaces/channels/embodiments, while the first implementation target remains deliberately narrow.

## Product thesis

Alsoul should feel like someone who knows you, lives in your world, and knows the limits of what they know and can do.

Its internal architecture may be sophisticated. The user's mental model should remain simple:

```text
                    Alsoul
                      │
       ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
       │              │              │
   knows me       has a world      can help me
       │              │              │
   remembers        can check      can act
   understands      can notice     can work
   our history      can observe    can follow up
```

The primary trust quality is **felt honesty**. When Alsoul says it remembers, checked, observed, inferred, acted, scheduled, produced, delivered, or is uncertain, those words should correspond to real internal state.

## Foundation principles

```text
Companion ≠ Model
Self ≠ Relationship ≠ World
Memory ≠ Observation
Historical Evidence ≠ Derived Memory
Observation ≠ Interpretation
Fact about a person ≠ PersonModel claim ≠ Interaction Policy
Search result ≠ Companion belief
Person ≠ Thread ≠ Surface ≠ Channel ≠ Embodiment
Identity ≠ Credential ≠ Authority
Capability availability ≠ permission ≠ approval ≠ effect
Failed effect ≠ uncertain effect
Context reset ≠ historical deletion
Memory proposal ≠ memory admission
Generated output ≠ adopted output ≠ presented output ≠ heard output
Authoritative result ≠ context projection
Procedure ≠ Trigger ≠ WorkRun
Task ≠ Commitment
WorkRun ≠ Action
Action ≠ ExecutionAttempt ≠ Effect
WorkArtifact ≠ WorkProduct ≠ Delivery
WorldSignal ≠ Observation
background work ≠ proactive contact
```

## Foundation walking skeleton

The first vertical slice remains intentionally much smaller than the full architecture. It proves one continuous companion that can:

1. recover the same durable person and relationship after complete process death;
2. recover one evidence-grounded personal memory;
3. receive a question requiring current external information;
4. perform a real investigation and preserve what was actually checked;
5. derive an evidence-backed world result;
6. build an immutable ContextProjection carrying exact personal/world provenance;
7. bind one model invocation to that projection;
8. distinguish generated candidate output from Alsoul-adopted output and actual shared-history presentation; and
9. present memory, checked information, and interpretation as distinct epistemic classes.

The target interaction should be mechanically capable of meaning:

```text
"You told me ..."
"I checked ..."
"My take is ..."
```

without those distinctions being prompt conventions or stylistic guesses.

Effectful external Actions, background delegated work, proactive monitoring, multi-channel delivery, and rich embodiment are architecturally bounded but deliberately excluded from the first implementation slice.

## Status

Pre-implementation foundation checkpoint through Decision 10.B.

The next major architecture boundary is `SurfaceBinding` / `ChannelBinding` / `EmbodimentBinding`. In parallel, the project is ready to freeze the first vertical-slice physical schema and convert foundation acceptance contracts into executable tests.
